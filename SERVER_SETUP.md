# Email Server Setup Instructions

This document explains how to set up the server for handling contact form submissions and sending emails.

## Prerequisites

1. Node.js installed on your computer or server (download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/))
2. A Gmail account to send emails from

## Setup Steps

### 1. Install Dependencies

Open a terminal/command prompt in your project folder and run:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install all the required packages defined in package.json.

### 2. Configure Gmail for Sending Emails

For security reasons, Gmail requires you to use an "App Password" instead of your regular password:

1. Go to your Google Account settings: [myaccount.google.com](https://myaccount.google.com/)
2. Enable 2-Step Verification if you haven't already
3. Go to "Security" â†’ "App passwords"
4. Select "Mail" as the app and "Other" as the device (name it "Portfolio Contact Form")
5. Click "Generate" and copy the 16-character password

### 3. Update Email Configuration

Open `server.js` and update the email configuration:

```javascript
const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
  service: 'gmail',
  auth: {
    user: 'your-email@gmail.com', // Replace with your Gmail address
    pass: 'your-app-password'     // Replace with the app password you generated
  }
});
```

### 4. Start the Server

Run the following command to start the server:

```bash
npm start
```

The server will start on port 3000 by default (or another port if specified in the environment).

## Hosting Options

For a production environment, you'll need to host this server. Some options include:

1. **Heroku**: Easy deployment, has a free tier
2. **Vercel**: Good for Node.js applications
3. **DigitalOcean**: More control, requires more setup
4. **AWS**: Highly scalable, more complex setup

## Troubleshooting

- If emails aren't being sent, check your Gmail settings to ensure less secure apps are allowed
- Make sure your app password is correctly entered
- Check the server logs for any error messages

## Security Considerations

- Never commit your email password to version control
- In a production environment, use environment variables for sensitive information
- Consider implementing rate limiting to prevent abuse of your contact form
