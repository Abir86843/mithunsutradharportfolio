## Setup and Usage

1. Clone the repository
2. Open `index.html` in your browser

For the contact form to work properly in a production environment, you'll need to set up a server-side script to handle the form submission and send emails. The current implementation simulates a successful submission.

## Contact Form Setup

The contact form is currently set up to submit to: mithunsd44@gmail.com

To make the form fully functional, you'll need to:

1. Set up a server-side script (PHP, Node.js, etc.) to process the form data
2. Update the form submission code in `script.js` to point to your server endpoint
3. Implement email sending functionality on the server

## Customization

- Update the content in `index.html` to personalize the portfolio
- Modify colors and styles in `styles.css` to match your personal brand
- Add your own projects to the Work section
- Update contact information with your own details
